ARIBA

You can purchase office supplies directly on ARIBA or do it through Margaret Cheng. It is recommended to do it through Margaret. You should either check the sheet posted outside Margaretâ€™s office to see if the item is listed there. If it is, the department will cover that cost. If it is not listed, you can email her the item name and number.

A complete list of most item names and their corresponding numbers can be found on the server here: \\128.95.226.210\sibl\0 Admin\Miscellaneous\Supplies.
