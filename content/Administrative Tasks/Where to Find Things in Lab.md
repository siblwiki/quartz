### Filing Cabinets

The filing cabinets have the study materials and the hard copy IRBs. They are organized by quarter and the IRB filing cabinet drawers  labeled as IRB 1,2, and 3. There is also a rolling cart of IRBs. IRBs are organized by IRB number. There’s a list of IRB numbers and corresponding IRB names and researchers in the yellow folder in the front of filing cabinet drawer IRB 1. The IRBs ascend numerically starting with the IRB 1 cabinet drawer, then IRB 2 cabinet drawer, then cabinet IRB 3 cabinet, then the IRB rolling cart. IRB numbers typically align with when the IRB was first submitted, so the lower the number, the older the original IRB.

The list of IRBs in the yellow folder should be updated when a new IRB is approved and added to the drawer. You will also find IRB information on the server in the “IRB reorganized folder’. The folder on the server has all the exempt IRBs as well. The exempt IRBs are usually not in the cabinets.
