PsyCal is where you reserve rooms and equipment. Go to the [UW Psychology page](https://psych.uw.edu/) -> Intranet (on the top right of the page) -> Log into your UW Net ID -> PsyCal -> Reserve a Room OR Reserve Equipment. We reserve rooms for SIBL meeting and grad meetings. It is best to do this at least 3 weeks before the quarter starts because they fill up. We generally use KIncaid 102 or 108 for meetings. Â 

PsyCal can also be used to request keys for RAs.

Note: When you first log in to PsyCal, it sends a request to an administrator to approve your access. This might take a few days, so try to do this as one of your onboarding tasks
